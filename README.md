> Revolutionizes a customer's experience in a store using feasible technology by better connecting them with employees.

## Inspiration

Ever since the creation of department stores, if a customer needed assistance, he or she would have to look for a sales representative. This is often difficult and frustrating as people are constantly on the move. Some companies try to solve this problem by implementing stationary machines such as kiosks. However, these machines can only answer specific questions and they still have to be located. So we wanted to find a better way to feasibly connect customers with in-store employees.

## What it does

Utilizing NFC technology, customers can request help or find more information about their product with just a simple tap. By tapping their phone on the price tag, one's default browser will open up and the customer will be given two options:   
**Product link** - Directly goes to the company's website of that specific product  
**Request help** - Sends a request to the in store employees notifying them of where you tapped (eg. computers aisle 5)  

The customer service representative can let you know that he or she is on the way with the representative's face displayed on the customer's phone so they know who to look for. Once helped, the customer can provide feedback on the in-store employee. Using Azure Cognitive Services, the customer's feedback comments will be translated to a score between 0-100 in which the information will be stored. All of this can be performed without an app, just tapp.
